How to use the app:
	A good app shouldn't need instructions on how to use it
	But this one is straight-forward anyways.
	Click the buttons to navigate the pages.
	Adjust the settings in the settings tab and save them to deploy them to the rest of the app.
	Resetting the app data in the settings page will remove all changes you have made to the core data and reset the app to it's initial state.
	Scroll up and down in the encyclopedia page to view all games.
	Click on games in the encyclopedia table view controller to view them in detail.
	In the edit game and new game pages you must scroll to the bottom of the scroll view to save the new game or save your changes to the game.
	Use the find your game feature to tell which qualifications you have and it will return a set of games catered to your situation.
