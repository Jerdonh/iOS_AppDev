At 7 the player must instead say 14 - 2. At 14 the player must instead say 7,\nExamples of new rules that players can create are: Instead of 2 the player must drink - Players must say 9 in a high pitched voice - Players must skip multiples of 8 - etc...,\nIf a rule is ever broken then the person who broke the rule must drink and the count starts again from 1 with the person after the rule breaker,\nIf a player reaches 21 the count starts again at 1 with the player immediately to the left of the player who reached 21"
